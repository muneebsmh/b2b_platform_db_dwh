Please follow the following steps to create and populate the database:
1) In the MySQL Workbench, copy paste the content of the script "CREATE__statements.sql" and run it. This will create the **B2b_platform** database and the required tables.
2) Then open the "INSERT__statements.sql" and run it to populate all the tables created in step 1. 

**Next Step: combined_log_format_generator**
