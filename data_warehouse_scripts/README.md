Please follow the following steps to create the data warehouse:

1) In the MySQL Workbench, open and run the "CREATE__statements_DWH.sql" script to create the **dwh_b2b_platform** data warehouse.
2) Then load and run the contents of all the scripts starting with "SP__". This will create the stored procedures required to populate our data warehouse with change data capture, and ETL and exceptions logging mechanism. 

**Next Step: dwh_runner**
