After we have created the **dwh_b2b_platform** data warehouse, It is now the time to load the data warehoue and test our ETL process. The steps are:

1) Clone the **dwh_runner** directory in your local directory and load the python project.
2) Set the arguments required to run this project in the configuration, you may as well create the virtual environment if you wish.
3) Run the python program.

_These are the sample arguments which I used in my local project:_
--host
localhost
--username
test
--password
test
--database
dwh_b2b_platform
